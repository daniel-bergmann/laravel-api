### Laravel api

This is a laravel api with protected routes. A CRUD backend with auth. The database used is SQLite and I look forward to expand this boilerplate further with some UI framework. 

I order to use the api run "comoposer install" in the command line to get packages.

to run the app write "php artisan serve"
